# Awesome Backend

This is a test project to experiment with integration of GitHub, JIRA, Jenkins, and OpenShift. We will add more content to this README as we make progress in the project.

# Testing Triggers

1. Making comments on JIRA issues through git commits. 
2. Setting workflow status through git commits. (**Buggy**) 
3. Showing that pull request shows up in the story now.
